The reason I taking this course because I have a passion in open-source development, I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/users/5512611/huy-nguyen&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; daily as where I can find useful answers to solve programming problems, I had some experience in Android &amp;amp; Web development, I used many libraries and they were really helpful for me to develop applications, so I just love how great they are and by taking this course I want to be involved in some of those projects, not huge but some contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From trending repositories on Github, I picked the one called “Algorithms” at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/VietnameZe/Algorithms&quot;&gt;https://github.com/VietnameZe/Algorithms&lt;/a&gt; just because I used to be a team member in a competitive programming contest many years ago so I have  interests in algorithms and stuffs like that. I didn’t have a depth look at it but basically what I see is a compilation of different popular algorithm implementations with estimated complexity. I just love that!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Minh Huy Nguyen</name></author><category term="posts" /><summary type="html">Hi my name’s Huy Nguyen and I taking OSD600 course, currently located in Vaughan - just North of Toronto.
